title: ReactiveMongo 0.11.2 - The Collection API
---

## The Collection API

The Collection API is designed to be very extensible, allowing the use of third-party libraries for building documents (ie use something else than the embedded BSON library), including specific serializers and deserializers. For example, that's the case of the [ReactiveMongo Play plugin](https://github.com/ReactiveMongo/Play-ReactiveMongo), which relies on the [Play JSON library](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/ScalaJson) instead.

{% highlight scala %}
// using the default Collection implementation
// (relying on the embedded BSON library)

import reactivemongo.bson._
import reactivemongo.api.collections.default._

case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
object Person {
  implicit val reader: BSONDocumentReader[Person] = Macros.reader[Person]
}

val collection: BSONCollection = db.collection("people")

// find people who are older than 25
val query =
  BSONDocument("age" -> BSONDocument("$gt" -> 25))

// run the query then convert the result to a `Person` instance
// using the implicit (BSON) reader
val result: Future[Option[Person]] = collection.find(query).one[Person]
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scala %}
// using the Play plugin's Collection implementation
// (relying on Play's JSON library)

import play.api.libs.json._
import play.modules.reactivemongo.json.collection._

case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
object Person {
  implicit val reader: Reads[Person] = Json.reads[Person]
}

val collection = db.collection[JSONCollection]("people")

// find people who are older than 25
val query =
  Json.obj("age" -> Json.obj("$gt" -> 25))

// run the query then convert the result to a `Person` instance
// using the implicit (JSON) reader
val result: Future[Option[Person]] = collection.find(query).one[Person]
{% endhighlight %}

This is very useful when you don't want to explicitly convert your objects into yet another different structure â€“ if your application uses JSON, it is perfectly understandable to want to avoid using BSON only for dealing with MongoDB.

### The `Collection` trait

This trait is almost empty.

{% highlight scala %}
// simplified for the sake of readability
trait Collection {
  /** The database which this collection belong to. */
  def db: DB
  /** The name of the collection. */
  def name: String
  /** The default failover strategy for the methods of this collection. */
  def failoverStrategy: FailoverStrategy

  // already implementated methods

  /** Gets the full qualified name of this collection. */
  def fullCollectionName = db.name + "." + name

  /**
   * Gets another implementation of this collection.
   * An implicit CollectionProducer[C] must be present in the scope, or it will be the default implementation ([[reactivemongo.api.collections.default.BSONCollection]]).
   *
   * @param failoverStrategy Overrides the default strategy.
   */
  def as[C <: Collection](failoverStrategy: FailoverStrategy = failoverStrategy)(implicit producer: CollectionProducer[C] = collections.default.BSONCollectionProducer): C = ...

  /**
   * Gets another collection in the current database.
   * An implicit CollectionProducer[C] must be present in the scope, or it will be the default implementation ([[reactivemongo.api.collections.default.BSONCollection]]).
   *
   * @param name The other collection name.
   * @param failoverStrategy Overrides the default strategy.
   */
  def sibling[C <: Collection](name: String, failoverStrategy: FailoverStrategy = failoverStrategy)(implicit producer: CollectionProducer[C] = collections.default.BSONCollectionProducer): C = ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

All collections implementations must mix this trait in. They also provide implicit objects of type `CollectionProducer` that make new (specialized) instances of them. Since `db.collection()` is parametrized with `C <: Collection` and accepts an implicit `CollectionProducer[C]`, the returned instance of collection can be inferred to the right type if there is only one producer in the implicit scope, which is a typical situation.

{% highlight scala %}
// db.collection() simplified signature
def collection[C <: Collection](name: String)(implicit producer: CollectionProducer[C])
{% endhighlight %}

Most implementations actually extend another trait, `GenericCollection`.

### The `GenericCollection` trait


This trait is much more complete than `Collection`. It defines common methods, like `find()`, `update()`, `remove()` and `insert()`, among others. One particularity of them is that they may be given ...

`GenericCollection` takes 1 type parameter: the `SerializationPack`.

TODO

Let's take an example of how these types are used with `find()`, which is defined like this:

{% highlight scala %}
def find[S](selector: S)(implicit swriter: Writer[S]): GenericQueryBuilder[Structure, Reader, Writer]
{% endhighlight %}

This method takes a `selector` (or query), of type `S`. This object is then transformed into BSON thanks to the implicit `swriter` parameter. Moreover, you can notice that the return type is another trait, `GenericQueryBuilder`, with the same paramater types.

### The `GenericQueryBuilder` trait

A `GenericQueryBuilder`, like its name says it, helps building and customizing the query.

TODO

### Examples

- The default implementation in ReactiveMongo, `BSONCollection`. It relies on the embedded BSON library, with `BSONCollection` as the `Structure`, and `BSONDocumentReader` and `BSONDocumentWriter` as the de/serializer typeclasses.
- The implementation in the Play plugin, `JSONCollection`. It uses `JsObject` (a JSON object), and the de/serializer typeclasses `Writes` and `Reads`.
